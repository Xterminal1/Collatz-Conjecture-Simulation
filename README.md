# Collatz-Conjecture-Simulation
This Python script simulates the Collatz conjecture. The script takes an input integer to be tested and runs iterations until the integer equals 1. This code can also calculate the number of iterations and the highest number reached during those iterations. This process is also plotted on Matplotlib on a separate window.

Thanks to @TerminalX3 for helping.
